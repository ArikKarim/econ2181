# ECON 2181 - Specific Factors Model Analysis

## Baseline Equilibrium Results

### Equilibrium Relative Price
The equilibrium relative price (P_M/P_A) is **0.8338**, indicating that manufacturing goods are relatively cheaper than agricultural goods in the baseline equilibrium.

### Wages
- **Home country wage (w_H):** 0.6251
- **Foreign country wage (w_F):** 0.4375

Home has a higher wage due to its greater factor endowments (K_H=4.0 vs K_F=2.0 for capital, and T_H=3.0 vs T_F=1.0 for land).

### Labor Allocations
**Home Country:**
- Manufacturing: 2.29 workers (45.8% of labor)
- Agriculture: 2.71 workers (54.2% of labor)

**Foreign Country:**
- Manufacturing: 2.80 workers (56.0% of labor)
- Agriculture: 2.20 workers (44.0% of labor)

Foreign allocates more labor to manufacturing despite having less capital, due to the equilibrium price structure.

### Outputs
**Home Country:**
- Manufacturing output (Y_H,M): 2.86
- Agriculture output (Y_H,A): 2.82

**Foreign Country:**
- Manufacturing output (Y_F,M): 2.45
- Agriculture output (Y_F,A): 1.61

### Trade Pattern (Baseline)
Given that both countries have identical demand shares (α = 0.5 for agriculture) and incomes are determined by production, Home country has a comparative advantage in both goods but is relatively more efficient in agriculture (higher land endowment). However, with the equilibrium price P_M/P_A = 0.8338, Foreign country specializes more in manufacturing (56% of labor vs Home's 46%), suggesting Foreign may export manufacturing while Home exports agriculture. This pattern reflects the interaction between factor endowments and the equilibrium price ratio.

## Effects of 20% Increase in Manufacturing Productivity

### New Equilibrium Price
The equilibrium relative price **decreases from 0.8338 to 0.6948** (a 16.67% decline). This occurs because the productivity increase in manufacturing shifts the relative supply curve rightward, leading to an excess supply of manufacturing goods and requiring a lower relative price to clear the market.

### Productivity Changes
- Manufacturing productivity (Z_M) increases from 1.0 to 1.2 in both countries
- Agriculture productivity (Z_A) remains unchanged at 1.0

### Labor Allocations (After Shock)
The labor allocations remain **virtually unchanged**:
- Home: Manufacturing = 2.29, Agriculture = 2.71
- Foreign: Manufacturing = 2.80, Agriculture = 2.20

This result is notable: despite the productivity increase making manufacturing more attractive, the equilibrium adjustment through price changes offsets the incentive for labor reallocation, maintaining the same labor distribution.

### New Outputs
**Home Country:**
- Manufacturing: 2.86 → **3.44** (+20.00%)
- Agriculture: 2.82 → 2.82 (unchanged)

**Foreign Country:**
- Manufacturing: 2.45 → **2.94** (+20.00%)
- Agriculture: 1.61 → 1.61 (unchanged)

Manufacturing output increases proportionally to the productivity increase, while agriculture output remains constant due to unchanged labor allocation and agriculture productivity.

### Relative World Production & Prices
- **Relative world production (Y_M/Y_A):** Increases from 1.199 to **1.439** (+20.00%)
- **Relative price (P_M/P_A):** Decreases from 0.8338 to **0.6948** (-16.67%)

The supply effect dominates: world production of manufacturing relative to agriculture increases, while the equilibrium price falls to balance supply and demand.

### Real Wages and Welfare

**Real Wages in Terms of Agriculture (w/P_A):**
- **Unchanged** in both countries (w/P_A = 0.6251 for Home, 0.4375 for Foreign)

**Real Wages in Terms of Manufacturing (w/P_M):**
- Home: 0.7497 → **0.8996** (+20.00%)
- Foreign: 0.5247 → **0.6296** (+20.00%)

### Welfare Analysis
**Both countries experience welfare improvements:**
- While real wages in terms of agriculture remain constant, real wages in terms of manufacturing increase by 20%, matching the productivity gain
- Consumers can now afford more manufacturing goods, while their purchasing power for agriculture remains the same
- The productivity gains in manufacturing are fully passed through to consumers via lower manufacturing prices, benefiting all consumers in both countries
- **Overall welfare increases** because workers' purchasing power rises for manufacturing goods, and since consumers spend on both goods, their overall consumption bundle improves

### Economic Interpretation
The productivity shock demonstrates several key economic mechanisms:
1. **Supply Effect:** Increased manufacturing productivity shifts the relative supply curve right, producing more manufacturing goods
2. **Price Effect:** The increased supply lowers the relative price of manufacturing to restore equilibrium
3. **Wage Effect:** Nominal wages remain constant, but real wages in terms of manufacturing rise
4. **Welfare Effect:** All consumers benefit from the productivity gains through improved purchasing power for manufacturing goods

The analysis confirms that productivity improvements in one sector can generate economy-wide welfare gains when markets adjust through price mechanisms.
